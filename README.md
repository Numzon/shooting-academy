Purpose: Improve my Front-end skills

Project ends up when all points below are readys:

- HomePage / Landing Page
- AuthenticationPage + PocketBase Auth configured
- Contact Page / Contact Form + PocketBase stores thats data
- Project is responsive for:
  - 0 - 600px: Phone
  - 600 - 900px: Tablet portrait
  - 900 - 1200px: Tablet landscape
  - 1200 - 1800px: Regular (default for this project)
  - 1800px + : Big desktop
- Pages can be handled by old browses (sass @support etc)
- Most important pages are ready:
  - Home

There is a chance that number of points would be expanded.

IMPORTANT:

If you want to run this project - use laptop screen as it is not responsive yet
Currently you don't have to deal with pocketbase app, just npm install and npm run dev

TODO:

1. Unit tests setup (many components that need testing already)
2. Packages for clients section (cards with price on the background - card move to back when hovered)
